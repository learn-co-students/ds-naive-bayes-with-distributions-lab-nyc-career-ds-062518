    "________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Bayesian Classifiers are \"Naive\" because they assume independence among predictor variables.  Although the independence assumption may potentially make our classifier less accurate in situations where predictor variables are highly correlated, it is often a necessary evil because the sheer number of conditional probabilities we would need to calculate for a non-naive bayesian approach grows at a crazy rate ($2^{n+1}$ for every binary feature added!)  For example, if our dataset had 3 binary-featured predictor columns, we would need to calculate 16 conditional probabilities.  Additionally, our dataset may not contain examples of every possible combination for each conditional probability, meaning that the requirements for the amount of data we need would also skyrocket.  By assuming independence, we reduce our computational cost down to simply computing the joint conditional probability of the factors, which is just the product of the conditional probability of each our target and each individual factor.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Specifically, we'll be using Naive Bayes for **_Classification_**, which allows us to predict the class of something.  The scikit-learn library (sklearn for short!) contains 3 different versions of Naive Bayesian Classifiers we can use to make predictions based on the distributions of the data it contains.  Before we can do that, however, we'll need to prepare our data by splitting it into training and testing sets, so that we can test how accurate our model is likely to be on real world data (since models sometimes have a problem with memorizing training data rather than actually \"learning\" what's needed to make predictions in the real world)."
